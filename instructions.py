             1 - Resume Rules:

                    -Keep It Concise: Typically, a resume should be no longer than one or two pages. Aim to convey your qualifications and experiences as succinctly as possible.

                    -Tailor Your Content: Customize your resume for each job application. Align your skills and experiences with the job description, emphasizing relevant accomplishments.

                    -Use a Professional Format: Choose a clean, professional layout with consistent formatting. Use clear headings, bullet points, and legible fonts like Arial or Times New Roman (10-12 pt).

                    -Highlight Achievements: Focus on quantifiable achievements rather than routine duties. Use action verbs and numbers to demonstrate your impact.

                    -Include Keywords: Incorporate industry-specific keywords and phrases from the job listing. This helps your resume pass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).
